# **Travel Recommendation App**

## **Overview**
The **Travel Recommendation App** is a machine learning-powered recommendation system that suggests travel packages and hotels based on user preferences. Built using Python, Streamlit, and data science techniques, this app provides tailored recommendations for travelers looking for the perfect getaway.

---

## **Features**
- **Hotel Recommendations**: Suggests hotels based on cosine similarity using TF-IDF and user-selected filters.
- **User-Friendly Filters**: Allows users to refine recommendations by package type, start city, price range, and destination.
- **Feedback System**: Collects user feedback to enhance the recommendation engine.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and optimizes the dataset for better recommendations.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Offers an interactive and intuitive UI for users.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
  - Streamlit: Web application framework
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization (optional future use)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## **Installation and Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Souvik-karmakar/Travel-Recommendation-App.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Travel-Recommendation-App
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## **How It Works**
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (`dataset.csv`).
2. Apply TF-IDF vectorization to compute the similarity between hotels.
3. Filter results based on user preferences.
4. Display recommendations on a Streamlit interface.

---

## **Dataset Details**
- **Sample Size**: 5000 rows (configurable)
- **Key Columns**:
  - `Hotel Details`
  - `Destination`
  - `Package Type`
  - `Price Per Two Persons`
  - `Start City`

**Note**: Missing or invalid rows are handled during preprocessing.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select preferences:
   - Package Type
   - Start City
   - Destination
   - Maximum Price
3. Click **"Get Recommendations"** to view the results.
4. Provide feedback via the integrated form.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add visualization of recommendation insights.
- Incorporate user reviews for enhanced personalization.
- Extend compatibility with dynamic datasets.
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
